Reflections

1. I estimate that I spent about 7 hours working on this project.

2. The most rewarding challenge was figuring out how to use one class inside another class, although this project was
  full of challenges that have enabled me to achieve a greater understanding of how to program using Ruby.

3. The first additional feature that I built was a method to notify the user regarding low stock (< 2) remaining.  This
   allows the user to easily look up what products need to be reordered.  The second additional feature that I built was
   a method to calculate the value of the products left in stock.  This feature is something that I would like to have
   in an inventory tracking application.  It is helpful for a business owner to easily know the value of all products
   remaining in storage.

4. I have a lot of work to do regarding memorizing Ruby syntax and functionality.  My goal is a fluency in Ruby.
